# React Developer Test

## The Task

Create a page that allows the user to select a country from a list and enter their population. 
This task should take 2-3 hours but don't worry if you aren't able to complete all items, just 
make sure to show your understanding of the core technologies we use.

1. Fork this repo
2. Get the list of available countries from the country API in `src/api/country.js`
3. Create a form which allows the user to select a country from a dropdown and enter their population
4. Sort the countries by population
5. Allow entries to be updated
6. Allow entries to be deleted
7. Add some styling
8. When you're done commit your code and create a pull request

A basic project outline has been created to help you get started quickly but feel free to start 
from scratch if you have a prefered setup.

We predominantly use React, Redux, StyledComponents, Node.js, Webpack, Babel

Feel free to use the internet including Google and Stackoverflow to help with the task
