# Karmarama Test

Front end developer test as part of Karmarama interview process.

## Heuristics

[heuristic](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_(computer_science)>)
/ˌhjʊ(ə)ˈrɪstɪk/

> A technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution

I believe:

- Priority is the best User Experience
- Complexity should be introduced when it's inevitable
- Code should be easy to reason about
- Code should be easy to delete
- Developers should avoid abstracting too early
- Developers should avoid thinking too far in the future
